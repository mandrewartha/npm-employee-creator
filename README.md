# npm employee creator

This node application was built using test driven design. NPM Inquirer and Jest were used to create a question and answer set up and to be able to run the tests. Tests were written for each type of employee that dictated what needed to be created. JavaScript and HTML were used to complete the project and set up the HTML site.
